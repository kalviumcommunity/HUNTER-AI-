# üéØ Multishot Prompting in Hunter AI Book Recommendation System

## Overview

Hunter now implements **multishot prompting**, a sophisticated approach that provides the AI with multiple diverse examples to learn from, resulting in significantly better book recommendations and more natural conversational responses.

## üöÄ What is Multishot Prompting?

Multishot prompting goes beyond simple few-shot learning by providing the AI with **multiple diverse examples** across different categories and scenarios. Instead of just one example per category, the system now provides 2-3 examples that demonstrate:

- **Variety in response styles** and depths
- **Different approaches** to similar requests
- **Context-aware recommendations** based on user preferences
- **Consistent quality** across various book genres and themes

## üîß Implementation Details

### 1. Enhanced Examples Library

The system now includes **5 main categories** with multiple examples each:

```javascript
const EXAMPLES = {
  default: [3 examples],      // General book requests
  horror: [2 examples],       // Horror/thriller requests
  mood_based: [2 examples],   // Mood-driven requests
  romance: [2 examples],      // Romance-specific requests
  fantasy: [2 examples]       // Fantasy/epic requests
};
```

### 2. Smart Example Selection

The system intelligently selects examples based on:

- **User input content** (keywords, genre mentions)
- **Mood indicators** (sad, excited, stressed)
- **Personality traits** (adventurous, romantic, curious)
- **Context relevance** (similar to previous requests)

### 3. Dynamic Context Integration

Each prompt now includes:

- **User preferences** (genres, themes, authors)
- **Reading history** (avoid list, recent recommendations)
- **Conversation context** (previous interactions)
- **Mood and personality** signals

## üìä Benefits of Multishot Prompting

### 1. **Better Learning**
- AI learns from multiple examples instead of just one
- Understands different ways to approach similar requests
- Develops more nuanced understanding of user preferences

### 2. **Improved Consistency**
- Multiple examples ensure consistent response quality
- Reduces variance in recommendation style
- Maintains conversational tone across different scenarios

### 3. **Enhanced Personalization**
- Better understanding of user reading patterns
- More accurate genre and theme matching
- Improved context awareness

### 4. **Higher Quality Recommendations**
- More detailed and relevant book explanations
- Better reasoning for why books match user requests
- Improved plot summaries and context

## üß™ Testing the System

### Run the Test Script

```bash
cd backend
npm run test:multishot
```

This will test 5 different scenarios and show how the multishot prompting adapts to each.

### Test Scenarios Included

1. **Dragon Romance Request** - Tests fantasy romance examples
2. **Horror Request** - Tests cosmic horror examples
3. **Mood-Based Request** - Tests uplifting/comfort examples
4. **Romance Request** - Tests enemies-to-lovers examples
5. **Fantasy Request** - Tests epic fantasy examples

## üîç Example Output Comparison

### Before (Single Example)
```
User: "I want dragon romance like Fourth Wing"
AI: Recommends 1-2 books with basic reasoning
```

### After (Multishot)
```
User: "I want dragon romance like Fourth Wing"
AI: Recommends 3-5 books with:
- Detailed reasoning for each recommendation
- Plot summaries
- Context about why each book matches
- Learning from multiple dragon romance examples
```

### Core Functions

```javascript
// Smart example selection
function selectRelevantExamples(input, mood, personality) {
  // Analyzes user input and selects most relevant examples
  // Combines primary and secondary examples for better learning
  // Limits to 3 examples for token efficiency
}

// Enhanced prompt building
export function buildPrompt({
  input, mood, personality, avoidList, 
  recentTurns, wantBuyLinks, userPreferences
}) {
  // Builds comprehensive prompts with multiple examples
  // Integrates user context and preferences
  // Provides rich context for AI learning
}
```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Required
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# Optional
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key  # For buy links
```

### Customization

You can easily add new examples by modifying the `EXAMPLES` object in `dynamicPrompt.js`:

```javascript
const EXAMPLES = {
  // ... existing categories
  mystery: [
    {
      user: "I want a good mystery novel",
      assistant: {
        recommendations: [
          // Your mystery examples here
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
};
```

## üìö Best Practices

### When Adding Examples

1. **Provide variety** within each category
2. **Include detailed reasoning** for each recommendation
3. **Use natural language** that matches user requests
4. **Maintain consistency** in response structure
5. **Consider cultural relevance** for your target audience

### Example Quality Guidelines

- **Clear user requests** that represent common scenarios
- **Detailed AI responses** that show expected depth
- **Varied book types** within each category
- **Realistic scenarios** that users might actually ask

## üéâ Conclusion

Multishot prompting transforms Hunter from a simple recommendation engine into an **intelligent, learning book advisor** that:

- **Understands context** better than ever before
- **Provides more relevant** and detailed recommendations
- **Learns from user interactions** to improve over time
- **Maintains consistency** across different request types
- **Offers a more natural** conversational experience

This implementation represents a significant step forward in AI-powered book recommendation systems, demonstrating how sophisticated prompting techniques can dramatically improve user experience and recommendation quality.
